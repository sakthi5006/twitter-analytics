ProspectComm,1005579287364169728---What kids look for in youth sports: Fun. Getting better. Learning new things. Competition. Trying to win. Playing with friends and people they didn’t know before. A pat on the back. Achieving and feeling good about it. Feeling like they matter. Good coaches help with all that.,1005907679208849408---Youth sports coaches: how a player treats teammates when they think no one else is around is often a better barometer of their real “character” than other measuring sticks- like scoring goals…,1004508368885637120---Most young athletes whether playing for fun or looking to have a future in their sport want to be pushed and challenged. That said it’s important for youth coaches to recognize that each of their players is different. When-and how- they do the “pushing” matters a lot.,1006684975519813633---Youth sports coaches: if you demand a lot of your players in terms of the “standards” you set great. But having those expectations is only credible if you exceed them yourself in terms of your own attitude behaviour consistency and your ability to build relationships—and trust,1011756922066780160---In goal-scoring sports like soccer you often hear youth coaches tell players: “you have to finish those”. Easier said than done. Most coaches can’t actually teach “finishing”. Unless a coach can it’s probably best to ease the pressure. A relaxed player will finish their share…,1009585353848569856---If you played youth sports and look back now and remember a coach that really had a positive impact on you -on or off the field- hopefully you can find a moment to reach out to them and let them know. They would no doubt appreciate knowing they made a difference in your life…,1009942781064708096---In youth sports it’s not always the most talented players that are the “best” or have the biggest impact on their team. Kids with heart drive and will who are team-first in their thinking are often the real leaders. They support their teammates and play hard every time out...,1008860212340523008---Simple test of your impact as a youth sports coach: Do your players love the game more at the end of the season? Are they more confident? Do they treat their teammates with respect? Do they train hard? Do they play with passion regardless of the score? If yes to all well done!,1010672750317326337---Taking courses and becoming a “certified” youth sports coach is important. But that won’t replace the desire to listen to understand and build relationships with kids or the innate ability to inspire them or to make them feel like a million bucks even when they’re struggling...,1010981560831508480---It’s great when youth sports Clubs honour former players who go on to excel at higher levels (college/pro). But it’s also important to recognize those who played at the Club who’ve gone on to achieve in other fields as well. It shows the Club has helped kids on—and off—the field.,1003393073827610625---If a kid in youth sports is afraid to try things and do things on the field that they would naturally or instinctively do for fear of being punished by coaches to them it feels like theyre playing with a piano on their back. They really need to be allowed to play without fear.

Sharapova will bring the best out of Serena and thats....,1003420081722970113---A rivalry is about more than the results when two people compete. e.g. Sugar Ray beat Jake LaMotta 5/6 times but it was still a rivalry. Look at 60s Lakers v Celtics too. It can be a rivalry if theyre the two biggest names or have real disdain for each other outside the sport.
