AlBernstein,watched  the DVR of  end of the NBA game from last night. oh my what a crazy ending. That is why sports is so riveting you can never script what nutty things will happen.,except in the last 18 months the fights have been terrific and the sport  has gotten more exposure--so how does that equate.,Steve--I hate arguing with you--but youre dead wrong--I am not a cheerleader for boxing but the last 18 months have been terrific--great product much more tv exposure and more mainstream media coverage. Sports not dying cause 1 fight did poorly.  You are better than this. LOL,I often follow people for one aspect of their tweets and am not interested in some other aspects. If that 90% on sports etc is not enough for you  then you have to do what you have to do.

brondmanmusic,Of course! Has been growing since my kids were little and the first World Cup help here. Not like the rest of the world but getting better all the time. Now main league have developmental league besides other lower leagues. It’ll just take time,We had it before many years ago! Help launch football  here as well.,That’s Me Judes.  I was singing to you yah know?? Ok there were a few others in the house but definitely to you!,Yippppppeeeee! Will let you visit US venue too Judes so you’re not just stuck in the Commonwealth. Hahahaha. That was the easy part! Now getting a worthwhile team,Out?? Passed out worn out thrown out???,Special it is Judes and all football  fans. Enjoy the excitement and hopefully success of y’all’s favorite teams.,I’ve been at a gig in the San Francisco Bay Area  called Novato Ca. Venue call HopMonk. We had a good night of music and a pretty decent turnout for Thursday and a long commute.pic.twitter.com/jjiUlEK6yk,You two but y’all won a really physical match and new threw in the towel. Not sure past teams would have done that. Great heart  = a victory that day. Bravo Cheers,Yes a win/3points is important but for it to come down to a late goal against Tunisia  isn’t the best sign. Hopefully get the nerves out and maybe some more mosquito repellent by the next match??????,Do you have the weekend off Jimmy??,Lol! We’ll see! Mexico  lost so badly to Sweden  Ooooof. Even an own goal for last! .,It’s been pretty chill. We’re not under the nationwide heat bubble. One of the advantages to being close to Pacific Ocean. Our yucky hot period starts soon though Aug-October! But for now it’s very nice. Are you off school now or in next session??,Are you going to go crazy you two??

galluslass,Are you really going to tell women looking at those pics that they must accept those “women”  as women? If not - why not? Into their changing rooms etc or they are bigots?  Competing in female sports? No wonder the media is picking up on this and folk are taking notice.,Does this extend to com changing rooms/showers dorms wards prisons sports though? I don’t see why it wouldn’t. This goes way beyond bathrooms. Are we even allowed to know to ask questions  to talk about it? Is this the end of sex segregated spaces sports scholarships etc?

ErnestJackson7_,Happy Father’s Day to all COACHES that have taught me so much more other than football or any sport and to all Father figures to their children.
therealsteavis,In my experience @magic_weekend is great for encouraging #rugbyleague fans to reflect on what they have in common rather than focus on rivalries. Much needed in Oz where the game is so mainstream most people follow their club rather than the sport.,Like wolfpack games people are still coming in. American sports go so long that being here for the start is considered optional.

EightThots,I can almost guarantee most peoples depression/unhappiness etc is because they never lift a weight run or play a sport/break a sweat or go hiking. Get some good exercise not walking. Exercise that gets your heart rate up and youll feel alive. Not the dead slug you are.

mulvihill79,People who say they dont get horse racing or wont even give it a try - and there are so so many of them - I almost feel sorry for them. There is simply nothing else in sports like the big race days. Give it a chance. You have no idea what youre missing. #Justify,American Pharoahs Belmont was the greatest sports event Ive ever been to...but I actually think Justify is an even better horse.Imagine that on your 17th birthday you had not so much as run a high school track meet and by your 18th you had won Olympic gold. Thats Justify. https://twitter.com/saratogagoose/status/1005589200673083392 …,The whole notion of TV everywhere or total audience must include out-of-home as a matter of course. Notice that OOH for Match 1 was more than 3x the streaming audience. Huge piece of sports consumption especially for younger viewers.

ProspectComm,What kids look for in youth sports: Fun. Getting better. Learning new things. Competition. Trying to win. Playing with friends and people they didn’t know before. A pat on the back. Achieving and feeling good about it. Feeling like they matter. Good coaches help with all that.,Youth sports coaches: how a player treats teammates when they think no one else is around is often a better barometer of their real “character” than other measuring sticks- like scoring goals…,Most young athletes whether playing for fun or looking to have a future in their sport want to be pushed and challenged. That said it’s important for youth coaches to recognize that each of their players is different. When-and how- they do the “pushing” matters a lot.,Youth sports coaches: if you demand a lot of your players in terms of the “standards” you set great. But having those expectations is only credible if you exceed them yourself in terms of your own attitude behaviour consistency and your ability to build relationships—and trust,In goal-scoring sports like soccer you often hear youth coaches tell players: “you have to finish those”. Easier said than done. Most coaches can’t actually teach “finishing”. Unless a coach can it’s probably best to ease the pressure. A relaxed player will finish their share…,If you played youth sports and look back now and remember a coach that really had a positive impact on you -on or off the field- hopefully you can find a moment to reach out to them and let them know. They would no doubt appreciate knowing they made a difference in your life…,In youth sports it’s not always the most talented players that are the “best” or have the biggest impact on their team. Kids with heart drive and will who are team-first in their thinking are often the real leaders. They support their teammates and play hard every time out...,Simple test of your impact as a youth sports coach: Do your players love the game more at the end of the season? Are they more confident? Do they treat their teammates with respect? Do they train hard? Do they play with passion regardless of the score? If yes to all well done!,Taking courses and becoming a “certified” youth sports coach is important. But that won’t replace the desire to listen to understand and build relationships with kids or the innate ability to inspire them or to make them feel like a million bucks even when they’re struggling...,It’s great when youth sports Clubs honour former players who go on to excel at higher levels (college/pro). But it’s also important to recognize those who played at the Club who’ve gone on to achieve in other fields as well. It shows the Club has helped kids on—and off—the field.,If a kid in youth sports is afraid to try things and do things on the field that they would naturally or instinctively do for fear of being punished by coaches to them it feels like theyre playing with a piano on their back. They really need to be allowed to play without fear.

Calling out fans isnt ok.,I LOVED the on track action. ZERO issues. Buschs bullcrap statement and whiny face were totally unnecessary. Fact is you dont tell a 40% full grandstand not to watch and expect the sport to see an INCREASE in the butts in the seats.

miichaeljsf,oh and side note I also hate when y’all sports people shit on us for getting our patches and lettermen jackets!1!1 it takes lots of time and work to EARN those. At east it takes 3 years of being in choir to get your choir patch & for drama it takes being in 6 shows to get it..,IMAGINE all the hard work we all put in just for it to be belittled because others think that we don’t put any work at all. It’s funny becuase most of us probably go out and support sports while some of y’all haven’t even stepped into a theatre before to watch a production (:,and I have nothing against sports obviously I enjoy watching various sports but I just want to say at the senior rally ONLY ATHLETES are recognized... they take the time to HONOR THREE ATHLETES every year. They don’t recognized the hundreds of VAPA students we have on campus,Theatre/any performing art in general might not be a sport but we fucking put hours into our art YEAR ROUND. Not just for a season oh no sir. In just one show alone we could be working 50+ hours. Which doesn’t include that time we take for ourselves to rehearse everything..

mrclarkinc,Its not just twitter/sports. Its business. Its just life. Folks really lack self awareness & fail to adapt because of it.Theres nothing wrong w/ being wrong. Its the ignorance of not knowing or the arrogance of not caring that will kill ya.,Even the players do this.LeBron used to go to Steph’s games. Rave about his play. Now NOTHING (unless it’s politics). Sports hating is part of the fun. I don’t real life hate these dudes. But I def sports hate em.

NewAgeBoxingUK,So many eyes on the sport tonight that wouldnt normally be there. I always use my mum as the benchmark. They wont understand what that was about or why it was shite. They wont understand that there was possibly an agreement to call it off after 4. They wont watch next time.,But the industry as a whole at times can be very very thin skinned when it comes to criticism.What we try is to be positive & sometimes thats hard to do. But on the whole boxing is a great sport & we try to support as many as we can to hopefully spread the word of the good
bayani13,Those Cavs fans jumping the two GSW fans is infuriating. Without knowing what was said prior they coulda at least confronted them while they were looking. It was 2 vs 5.Confirms what I think about Cavs fans; they have no moral code. Sports emotions has rendered them unhinged.

Rehan_ulhaq,I just hope for cricket’s sake that they eventually end up bringing in more teams in the World T20. Love it or hate it T20 cricket is the best format to increase the popularity of this sport in countries where cricket isn’t as big.,Had Bangladesh not won that match in 1999 the sport wouldn’t have grown in their country this much. Look at Ireland & how far they have come. There is an abundance of really good players in associate teams currently. More than ever before.,Have previously said I support anyone who thinks progressively about football in Pak. Be it Jiwa be it @UmaidWasim have nothing but respect for them. I wish everyone best of luck & hope the sport grows in Pakistan & gets due mileage. Encouraging to see all the WC transmission,Kick Off is a generic football/Sports term.

topdawg619,I’m so confused...teams pay to play in a 7v7 Tournament they travel to come down they try to win...and when they don’t all I hear... is it’s only 7v7....they why did you participate in the first place. Smh everyone enjoys winning...be a good sport and let them enjoy it.
THEChrisKessell,international events actually helped grow registrations and got more kids playing the sport in the US... wed be growing leaps and boundsWe have more access to top level soccer than EVER before... but we are not growing the amount of American players.,Hosting a World Cup isnt about growing the sport in the US like it was back then (it was about making money BTW... growing the sport was a byproduct)It is ONLY about making the people at the top of this sport more and more money Check out how the Copa American money ended up,I had LITERALLY been in fights with people because they had called me a soccer fag and I punched them in the mouth for it That still happening? Too many people involved in the governance of this sport need to get themselves out of their soccer bubbles and in to the real world

NerdNumbers,The NBA is the only sport where the top defensive players are considered Role Players. Is what it is. https://twitter.com/blanchardJRB/status/1005927544313597959 …,LeBron won the #NBAFinals MVP in 2016 coming back from a 3-1 deficit against winningest team in NBA history and did it by blocking a game-winning shot on the previous years Finals MVP. If that was a sports movie script youd be forced to rewrite it for being too over the top.,Why wont the player that had no decision to play for the team that drafted them and was forced to play at a discount for four years show they more loyalty?I will never ever ever side with teams over players in North American professional sports.

brendatracy24,OSU/LH supportersI don’t believe those who plead guilty no contest &/or are convicted/adjudicated for sexually violent crimes should get to play sports. This has been my stance since 2016 PRIOR to the LH story. If you have any add’l questions for me pls refer back to this.,The Big Sky Athletic Conference banned violent athletes from playing sports & the best college pitcher in the country wasn’t drafted to the MLB because of a child molestation case.The culture is shifting. Survivors you matter. Don’t ever forget that #SetTheExpectation,I think bringing on a player adjudicated for child molestation is a bad look but hey that’s just me  I tend to do this thing where I care more about human life than sports.
TheJeffGoldman,What you describe is the difference between a good teammate and a terrible one. Terrible teammates that also have to be yanked from games don’t retain jobs in pro sports for very long.We can’t pull citizenship based on poor sportsmanship. But we can choose to ignore them.
Becks_F1,Exactly! I hate when ‘Celebrities’ get to do things like that and have no clue about the sport.,Find out more about the sport. People will talk to you on the grid. Shouldn’t be a surprise.

nascar_opinion,You know the sport needs help when coming from the back is no longer difficult.Drivers do it every week now. Thats how far off some of the cars are.,I agree about the risks part my only disappointments are the field size & fairness.Obviously I know sports arent always fair but the idea that a driver could win 35 races finish 2nd once and lose the title doesnt sit well with me. https://twitter.com/MattWeaverAW/status/1012829779773591552 …,Ive been watching NASCAR full-time since 2002.Im at a point where I know I wont walk away from the sport but all of its issues are building up inside of me & Im ready to burst.This sport as betrayed you me and millions of other fans.Just not fair.,Im so dedicated to this sport but this race is becoming a low point for me.Today I was excited.  I knew today could be a day where someone gets aggressive someone takes a chance.And still we are left with a battle between the 4 & 78.Im sick. Im tired.,Yall dont understand.If @NASCAR gave a simple press conference talking about how the sport has loss direction & needs improvement Id be happy.It would boost morale give fans a sense of direction & solidify that the sport is always working to get better.#NascarOpinion,I want NASCAR to make an attempt at making things better.A press conference a plan something.I dont expect a change overnight but show me something.  Quit settling for the current status of the sport. https://twitter.com/jeff_gluck/status/1012094730824368130 …

JoshEberley,This universal respect and admiration from fans everywhere across all sports for a guy that battled and struggled to finally reach the pinnacle is clearly special. Its a contagious feeling and unfortunately I dont think a KD title will ever bring that to him or others.,The collective elation from the masses even from sports fans who dont frequent hockey for Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals is what Kevin Durant gave up leaving Oklahoma City.
GuyHeveldt,Listening to @pineyzb on Radio Sport this morning giving it to Andreas Heraf and NZ Football. Go on son. Got around to listening to the presser on my way to work (thanks for posting it @andrewvoerman)... “Disgraceful” is the only word describe his attitude.

nbjennings,Yes I know football and other brings in MILLIONS of dollars for colleges and that is why so much money is allotted to players but this is more about the fact that sports are more rewarded than academics. Both grades and sports can be maintained so don’t act like it’s rare.,Will I graduate with a 5.0? Yes.Will I graduate with any sort of academic scholarship? Maybe if I’m lucky.Will I graduate with any sort of athletic scholarship? No bc my sport isnt seen as a sport while Chad w/ the 1.8 GPA has a full ride bc he’s mediocre at baseball.,If you find yourself offended by the original tweet then you missed the point. The point isn’t attacking any sport. It’s pointing out that athletes should have to receive decent grades to receive a reward as big as a full ride

king_bans,3. How to make female sports generally more interesting. Women’s football is an eyesore. People should stop complaining about the gender pay inequality and actually take steps to correct it.Women would continue to earn shit if nothing is done about it.,Forbes 100 list of sports highest earners is out.No female on the list this year & everybody is throwing a tantrum.Dailymail that doesn’t talk about any female football star and very rarely talks about the rest to in other sports is criticising the system alongside Forbes.

yknasihi,Thats why a franchise fee can exist. And USSF and CSA are complicit. They treat the sport differently than any other national association in the world.,Thats what Ive been saying. Sport shouldnt be all or nothing. It should have a championship and amateur divisions with gradations in the middle.,Our perspectives are not merely different approaches to the same target; we see the sport in different ways and our visions for the future diverge. You and @DanLoney36 and those who think along the same lines must have invested too much time/money/dignity in MLS to ever turn back,Pro/rel in an open system allows clubs to cut their cloth according to their need. The US system is all or nothing. Large enterprise bullying municipalities millions on the line or nada - no sport for you.

The WC deserves to be in a country that never hosted it before instead of one who did 3 times. #Morocco2026#United2026,#United2026 #Morocco2026@fifaworldcup_fr @FIFAcom If football becomes a threat to countries like trump is managing to do that in order to win maximal votes why then we call it Sport spirit .

Ludicrously underused at international level.

brettbaker21,These guys train for their sport. Sure there are differing body types that are better suited for basketball or football but most of that is height. Take out players 67+ and Id say 75% of the remaining professional athletes couldve played soccer at a very high level,@ColumbusFutsal recognizes this and is out there reaching these kids. Many other futsal programs across the country are doing the same. Futsal isnt only a great developmental tool for soccer players its a vehicle for the sport for reaching the inner cities of America,Nah I agree with Dom for the most part. Barring 65+ players any athlete could be a really good soccer player if that was the sport they fell in love with from an early age. Youre seeing more of our best young athletes play and choose soccer so its changing quickly.

AaronBower,A closed shop is categorically not an option for rugby league right now. There was an insistence at todays press conference that promotion and relegation is an integral part of our sport. And theyre right,Somebody significant(ish) on Fleet Street once said that to me from down in London RL is a sport too busy spending its time arguing with itself to make any inroads outside the heartlands,No malice meant by this but this isn’t about how it’s perceived in the living rooms of St Helens Wigan and Batley. They’re already converted to the game. It’s about trying to open the sport up to a new audience. If we don’t try; the sport is doomed to fail

CaptainJLasc,The team selection was awful from Sampaoli. Croatia fully deserved it they bossed it in midfield. Mascherano Acuna Meza Caballero Otamendi and Perez etc arent good enough. Banega and Dybala should have been in the side even Rulli in goal and Icardi and Correa off Atletico.

Tresvantstreet,The Good Lord blesses everyone with something - in regards to sports you can only control what you can control you might not have the measurables everyone is looking for but heart and desire cannot be measured but it can be seen! #heart,It took me long time to realize that not everyone wanted to be good/great at sports some just are cool with being there or socializing with friends-not everyone have the GGA but 99.9% of those who don’t go all out always look back and regret it- you cannot get young back again!

JulieDiCaro,I once again renew my call for sports writers to do as much research when writing about violence against women as they would writing about an injury.,So you think you have what it takes to make it in sports media? Then start blogging podcasting tweeting and/or making videos. Do them all if you can because thats what the industries  are looking for these days.,But for the love of God stop telling us you deserve a job in sports media just because you  Love the Cubs more than anyone!<end rant>,And by the way you cant just focus on the sport you like best. Want to work in sports media? You better know a ton about a whole bunch of different sports. Even the ones you dont like.,Please by all means unfollow me for telling a guy to shut up about how proximate we are to A Handmaids Tale. I know you follow me for sports but I have to live in this country too as do millions of women without a platform. And yes Im angrier lately. You should be too.

yidoyidoyido,I havent seen Argentina defend this badly since the Falklands in 1982.,Just a quick reminder the last time Germany were knocked out in the groups was 1938.

bobbie0801,Let us not destroy our legacy heritage traditions when it comes to sports. Many Americans love our teams. We enjoy rooting for our players watching them play just as much as they enjoy playing. Our children look up to a lot of players. Do not take this from them over politics.,I agree. All players no matter the sport should stand. This is our heritage. Protesting any issue does not belong on the playing field or court. We need to separate politics from our sports and schools. So many other ways to make a political statement outside of sports.
GrandmaPattiA,Do YOU PEOPLE understand that to NOT stand for the National Anthem is unpatriotic ...and politics should be kept out of sports.#BoycottNFL

RepSwalwell,Looks like @realDonaldTrump may never meet another championship sports team. And I think most of the players are okay with that.
MattHammondShow,What’s remarkable about Trump canceling the Eagles White House visit is they handle the politics of sports better than any team in sports. They’re not impulsive or petty. They don’t name-call. They just have their convictions. It’s pretty telling.

If you factor late spring/early summer weather in I believe that to be 100% true @bobounds,Tip for MS State fans.. rally items such as the banana don’t carry over into other years or sports.  They end when the season ends.  If carried on they actually are rumored to turn into a curse.  Rally banana was fun but I don’t want to see any banana stuff when football starts.

bballbreakdown,If we all start to understand that it’s incredibly likely you’re going to end up like so many others we’ve seen with CTE people will simply stop playing that sport. It’s not even a question and we’re already seeing this. https://twitter.com/kingkai5/status/1010661958864048128 …,Let’s face it -the information we’ve discovered about CTE was intentionally hidden from us by the NFL for years since they are afraid it will be the end of their sport - and the end of the billions of dollars they make on the backs of the players.,Of course people always argue with me that people who play the sport “know the risks.” This is complete bullshit. First off no 14 year old should be put in that position to decide and quite clearly the parents themselves don’t know the information either.

readJerome,Sports has always been a huge political tool.,...how many times Serena wins. Plus one Sharapova win is weighted as very significant given how sports writers are itching to have her win. Theyll overhype it. More reason for Serena to be at her best and prevent that. Sharapova will bring the best out of Serena and thats....,A rivalry is about more than the results when two people compete. e.g. Sugar Ray beat Jake LaMotta 5/6 times but it was still a rivalry. Look at 60s Lakers v Celtics too. It can be a rivalry if theyre the two biggest names or have real disdain for each other outside the sport.

ChiSportUpdates,According to Sports Illustrated Sammy Sosa was going to return to the Chicago Cubs with a public apology in 2014 but for some reason he then backed out.
LimitGovt,@Comcast’s attempt to outbid @Disney for @21CF has failed as the DOJ has approved the @Disney and @21CF deal contingent upon Disney divesting Fox’s regional sports networks. Comcast has too much industry influence as it is—it’s time they give up on their quest to monopolize.,@TheJusticeDept has cleared @Disney’s acquisition of @21CF but is requiring they sell Fox’s regional sports networks. The DOJ should now address @Comcast’s extreme market power as it only attempts to get bigger and more powerful.,The DOJ has just greenlighted the Disney/Fox deal—but not without first requiring Disney to divest Fox’s 22 regional sports networks. This proves the DOJ realizes the dangers that accompany mass media consolidation next we must turn to reining in @Comcast!

Nick_Durst,I think I’ve proved my point since you guys ignore everything I say and do not answer any question. There’s no reasoning with Yankee fans. Not sure why I even bothered.,Do you forget that garbage performance Severino had in the wild card game? I still don’t understand how you can say AL is a better league when there are less teams over .500 and only 1 team over in Central and 2 teams with less than 30 wins. C’mon.,@PicoDe_Gallo @SI_sports  you guys are funny but you are also Yankee fans. Give me the guy with the lower ERA earned runs allowed FIP hits allowed higher WAR and postseason track record. Throw wins out the door because Severino does not have 12 wins if he isn’t on yanks.

CoachJasonWitt,I don’t coach because I like winning. I coach to build relationships with athletes who can then use that relationship to  get to where they want to go through sports.,Adversity through sports as in life is your best asset. Funnel that emotion into productive action to help conquer grand obstacles.,Success in sports is about how you approach sports. Its about hard work and its about being optimistic. They go hand-in-hand.

The Athletic is beyond lucky to have Alison Lukan who is the only reason I put up with them in any way.,Lol James Mirtle is back on his bullshit I see.

adamconlon2013,Hes back large and will be in charge once again best believe it because that is what will happen,Exactly which is why I dont belive Tyson would duck bellew too much is read into quotes nowadays,Gotta build up towards the big one cant just walk into it level will be stepped up till he becomes alphabet title holder across the board,Cunnighham was 6.3 and higher calibre still knocked him out truth is ether hand alone would have got the win last weekend bigger fights now,He didnt duck the rematches if you believe that you need to be drug tested,Sure hes said that but if offered a decent amount he will spark him out end of,How many times has other boxers done the same thing you say nothing to that but moan at fury like everyone has his entire UNDEFEATED career,given it was a professional sanctioned fight by the board of control then yeah the truth is he was never gonna go in against sum1 decent,how exactly did he get lucky he dominated big vlad in his own corrupt back yard quite easily hes coming back to claim the belts thats it,But Im not sure bellew will actually take a fight with him thats my point,Me nether he needs it and hes had a good career Tyson makes money on it too so its a win win and win again,26-0 and climbing back to the top of the mountain once again ..Deal with it,Every1 is raving but the truth is haye wasnt the same fighter against bellew he lost it years ago and bellew made money tyson kos him in 5,For all that it lasts for tyson destroys bellew whenever he wants to end it bellew beat an ageing ex world champ who ducked tyson twice,Tyson is more scared of the taxman than he his of Tony Bellew lets get it right bellew would be just another warm up,Have a day off  it will happen if bellew sticks around for his blockbuster knockout loss ending to his career which we know happens v fury

Caleb_Scism,The whole “soccer is a dumb sport” or “American’s don’t/shouldn’t like soccer” is ignorant and idiotic. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world and growing in the US.....Also if you are a “sports fan” and you don’t enjoy the World Cup then something’s off with you.
Ricardo__713,If you don’t like soccer don’t say anything bad just shut the fuck up. We get the World Cup for 1 month only every 4 years. We gonna be tweeting until July 15th. Deal with it or mute tweets. Don’t talk down on the sport.

alpharadtv,This book has been pretty popular among the Smash Bros community and FGC. Tennis has such an in depth mental game that can really help shed light on fighting games or any other competitive sport. Tennis is all about getting in your opponents head and misdirection. Its so neat.,Tennis is such an interesting sport. I see a lot of people saying Mario Tennis is a fighting game disguised as a sports game but they really dont understand the half of it. Read this if you can: https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314 …Tennis is one of the most interesting mental games ever.
